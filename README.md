# CNN-for-NLP-Twitter-Toxic-Comments
Let us build a Convolutional Neural network which would classify the toxic tweets! For this project, I have used the tweets dataset from t-davidson's repository. To create the word embeddings, I have imported the pre-formatted dataset from Stanford called as Global Vectors for Word Representation.
